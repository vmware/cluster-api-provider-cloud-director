# Quick Start

In this tutorial weâ€™ll cover the basics of how to use Cluster API to create one or more Kubernetes 
clusters on VMware Cloud Director. This document expects the readers to be familiar with the 
[Core CAPI](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) terminology like management cluster and workload cluster.

### VMware Cloud Director Setup

Refer to [Cloud Director setup](VCD_SETUP.md) for setting up the infrastructure and user roles.

### Common Prerequisites

Install below in your local environment
* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Clusterctl](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#install-clusterctl)

### Setup a Management cluster

It is recommended for VCD organization administrator to create at least one management cluster per tenant.
Refer to the detailed steps for [setting up a management cluster](MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER.md).

### Create a workload cluster
Once the management cluster is set up for tenant users, individual tenant users can create their Kubernetes workload 
cluster(s) using Cluster API. Refer to the detailed steps for [operating the workload clusters](WORKLOAD_CLUSTER.md).
