# Quick Start

In this tutorial weâ€™ll cover the basics of how to use Cluster API to create one or more Kubernetes 
clusters on VMware Cloud Director. This document expects the readers to be familiar with the 
[Core CAPI](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) terminology like management cluster and workload cluster.

### VMware Cloud Director Setup

Refer to [Cloud Director setup](VCD_SETUP.md) for setting up the infrastructure and user roles.

### Create a Management cluster

It is recommended for VCD organization administrator to create at least one management cluster per tenant.
Refer to [Management cluster set up](MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER.md) for the detailed steps.

Once the management cluster is created and prepared for tenants' access, tenants can create their workload cluster(s).

Refer to [workload cluster operations](WORKLOAD_CLUSTER.md) for more details.
